            <p>The Delta-X mission is a 5-year NASA Earth Venture Suborbital-3 mission to study the Mississippi
                River Delta in the United States, which is growing and sinking in different areas.
                River deltas and their wetlands are drowning as a result of sea level rise and reduced sediment inputs.
                The Delta-X mission will determine which parts will survive and continue to grow, and which parts will be lost.
                Delta-X begins with airborne and in situ data acquisition and carries through data analysis, model integration,
                and validation to predict the extent and spatial patterns of future deltaic land loss or gain.</p>
